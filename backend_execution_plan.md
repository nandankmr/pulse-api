# Node.js TypeScript Backend Execution Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to implement Node.js + TypeScript backend best practices for the pulse-api project, based on `rules.md`. The plan is divided into phases with detailed sub-steps, priorities, and validation criteria.

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup (High Priority)
1. **Project Structure**
   - Create modular structure: `src/` (modules/, shared/, config/), `tests/`, `scripts/`.
   - Organize by feature (e.g., user module with controller, service, repository, model, routes).
   - Ensure separation of concerns.

2. **TypeScript Configuration**
   - Enable strict mode in `tsconfig.json`.
   - Define interfaces, types, and enums for all entities.
   - Avoid `any` and `as` assertions where possible.

3. **Code Style and Quality**
   - Install and configure Prettier for formatting.
   - Set up ESLint with TypeScript plugin and rules.
   - Enforce camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes/types.

## Phase 2: Core Development (Medium to High Priority)
4. **Error Handling**
   - Implement custom error classes (e.g., NotFoundError).
   - Use try/catch in all async code.
   - Send consistent error responses (status, message, optional code).

5. **API Design**
   - Follow RESTful principles or GraphQL.
   - Validate inputs with class-validator or Joi.
   - Sanitize user input to prevent injection.
   - Use correct HTTP status codes and paginate responses.

6. **Database and ORM**
   - Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
   - Define TypeScript interfaces for entities.
   - Implement transactions for multi-operation consistency.
   - Apply soft delete where needed.

7. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - Integrate JWT or OAuth2.
   - Hash passwords with bcrypt or argon2.
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC).
   - Validate tokens on each request.

8. **Security Measures**
   - Use Helmet for HTTP headers.
   - Enable CORS selectively.
   - Implement rate-limiting for sensitive endpoints.
   - Protect .env files and audit dependencies.

## Phase 3: Operations and Monitoring (Medium Priority)
9. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - Set up structured logging with winston or pino.
   - Log at appropriate levels (error, warning, info).
   - Integrate monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana, Sentry).

10. **Testing**
    - Write unit tests for services and utilities.
    - Write integration tests for routes and DB interactions.
    - Use mocking for external dependencies.
    - Achieve 80% test coverage and integrate into CI/CD.

11. **Performance Optimization**
    - Use async/await over callbacks.
    - Avoid blocking the event loop.
    - Implement caching (Redis or in-memory).
    - Apply pagination, streaming, and batching for large datasets.

## Phase 4: Maintenance and Deployment (Low to High Priority)
12. **Dependency Management**
    - Keep package.json clean and updated.
    - Use exact versions for critical dependencies.
    - Run npm audit regularly.
    - Avoid unnecessary heavy dependencies.

13. **Environment and Config**
    - Use .env for variables.
    - Validate config at startup with zod, joi, or env-schema.
    - Maintain separate configs for dev, staging, production.

14. **Documentation**
    - Add JSDoc to functions, classes, and endpoints.
    - Maintain API docs with Swagger/OpenAPI.
    - Keep README updated with setup and scripts.

15. **CI/CD Setup**
    - Run lint, format, and tests on each PR.
    - Build TypeScript before deployment.
    - Ensure zero-downtime deployment.
    - Inject secrets securely in pipelines.

## Validation Criteria
- All code must pass linting and formatting.
- Tests must achieve 80% coverage and pass.
- No TypeScript errors or security vulnerabilities.
- Project must deploy successfully with proper configs.
- Documentation must be comprehensive.

## Notes
- This plan aligns with the 15 sections in `rules.md` for enterprise-level backend development.
- Execute in sequence, validating each phase before proceeding.
- Use this file as a reference for new chat threads if context is lost.
